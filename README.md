## Motivation
I made this game to improve my OOP skills in JS and along the way also learned some advanced CSS styles. Even it is a game with simplistic features, it is recieved with great excitement between my little newphews and nieces, even I myself enjoyed it a lot :)
## How to play
It is a 4-player game. Before racing players will choose their own cars. During the race they will be supporting them. When car reaches its destination, its position will be displayed. Just to make more fun there is available Nitrous Oxide Engine and you can also change cars' speed and weight. Playing with children is recommended.
